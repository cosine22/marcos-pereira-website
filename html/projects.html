              <strong>Tech120: FormCamera - </strong> This project was done in my Technology Design class in Spring 2022. My group used a raspberry pi, a camera and some python code to detect joint locations during lifts. The camera did require the subject to be wearing colored markers at their joints but we were able to detect locations/movements with this.

              <strong>Kenzle (personal) - </strong> This project I worked on and off on from September to November of 2022. It is a Kendrick Lamar song guess game in the format of Wordle. The player types and is given autocorrect suggestions of tracks to guess. When a player guesses, the game tells them whether the track is in a later or newer album, or correct album. As well as tell them location based of track number.
