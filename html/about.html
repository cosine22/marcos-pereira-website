              My name is Marcos Pereira and I am a Junior studying Web Programming & Desig at Purdue University. I am from the Boston area and am 20 years old. Things I enjoy include sports, hip hop, programming, barbecue, and traveling!

              I decided to make a website for my portfolio to not only test my skills but to also grow them. Some of the things I enjoyed about this project was being able to have total creative freedom. I have always liked the old windows themes so I couldn't help myself here. I also grew a lot of inspiraton from <a href="https://oklama.com/">oklama.com</a> Kendrick Lamar's website!
